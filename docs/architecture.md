# VOOM Architecture Overview

VOOM (Video Orchestration Operations Manager) is a policy-driven video library manager built in Rust. It uses a plugin-first architecture with a thin kernel, a custom DSL for policy configuration, and supports both native and WASM plugins.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Kernel is inert** — The kernel has zero media knowledge. It manages plugin lifecycle, event dispatch, and capability routing only.

2. **Capabilities, not types** — Plugins declare capabilities (e.g., `Execute { ops: [transcode], formats: [mkv] }`). The kernel routes work by matching required capabilities to available plugins.

3. **Plan as contract** — The policy evaluator produces serializable `Plan` structs describing what to do. Executors consume them. Plans can be inspected, approved, and audited before execution.

4. **Events for coordination** — Passive subscribers (storage, backup, SSE) communicate exclusively through the event bus. The CLI commands call the policy-evaluator and phase-orchestrator directly for deterministic progress reporting and concurrency control, dispatching lifecycle events (`PlanCreated`, `PlanExecuting`, etc.) for downstream subscribers.

5. **Domain types as lingua franca** — All plugins share types from `voom-domain`. WASM plugins access these types via WIT interfaces with MessagePack serialization at the boundary.

6. **Immutable data** — Domain types implement `Clone` but mutations produce new values.

## Two-Tier Plugin Model

### Native Plugins

- Compiled directly into the binary as Rust crates
- Zero overhead — direct function calls via trait objects (`Arc<dyn Plugin>`)
- Full access to the Rust ecosystem
- Used for performance-critical core functionality
- All implement the `Plugin` trait:

```rust
pub trait Plugin: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn version(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str { "" }
    fn author(&self) -> &str { "" }
    fn license(&self) -> &str { "" }
    fn homepage(&self) -> &str { "" }
    fn capabilities(&self) -> &[Capability];
    fn handles(&self, _event_type: &str) -> bool { false }
    fn on_event(&self, _event: &Event) -> Result<Option<EventResult>> { Ok(None) }
    fn init(&mut self, _ctx: &PluginContext) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
}
```

Plugins that participate in event-driven coordination override `handles()` and `on_event()`. Library-only plugins (policy-evaluator, phase-orchestrator, web-server) are called directly by the CLI and are not registered with the kernel — they don't participate in event dispatch.

The ffprobe-introspector is registered so its availability and capabilities are visible through
the kernel, but it does not subscribe to events. The CLI calls it directly for deterministic
progress reporting and worker-pool concurrency. The bus-tracer is a development tool that logs
events to a file with configurable glob-pattern filtering.

### `verifier` vs `health-checker`

Two distinct integrity concepts share similar names but check different things:

- **`voom health check`** (plugin: `health-checker`) — environment readiness:
  ffmpeg / mkvtoolnix presence, GPU availability, data-directory writability,
  database connectivity. Run periodically by the serve loop.
- **`voom verify`** (plugin: `verifier`) — per-file media integrity:
  container header (quick), full decode (thorough), or sha256 bit-rot (hash).
  Persisted to the `verifications` table, reportable via
  `voom verify report` and `voom report --integrity`.

The two are intentionally orthogonal and never share a database table.

See [`docs/usage/verify.md`](usage/verify.md) for `voom verify` usage details.

### WASM Plugins

- Compiled to WebAssembly (`wasm32-wasi`), loaded at runtime via wasmtime 29
- Sandboxed execution — cannot directly access filesystem or network
- Language-agnostic — write in any language that compiles to WASM (Rust, Go, C, Zig)
- Communicate with host via WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types)
- Host provides sandboxed capabilities: file metadata, tool invocation, key-value storage, HTTP, logging
- Slight MessagePack serialization overhead at the boundary
- Manifests are TOML files alongside `.wasm` files

## Capability System

Plugins declare capabilities using the `Capability` enum. The kernel matches required capabilities to available plugins for routing:

```rust
pub enum Capability {
    Discover { schemes: Vec<String> },        // e.g., ["file", "smb"]
    Introspect { formats: Vec<String> },      // e.g., ["mkv", "mp4", "avi"]
    Execute { operations: Vec<String>, formats: Vec<String> },
    Store { backend: String },                // e.g., "sqlite"
    DetectTools,
    ManageJobs,
    ServeHttp,
    Plan,
    Backup,
    EnrichMetadata { source: String },        // e.g., "radarr", "sonarr"
    Transcribe,
    Synthesize,
}
```

Capabilities are used for plugin registration and discovery. Currently, executor routing uses priority-ordered event dispatch: when a `PlanCreated` event is published, the first executor that claims it (via `EventResult.claimed`) handles the plan. Capability-based routing is planned for a future sprint; the registry currently uses name-based lookup only.

## Event Bus

The event bus is the sole communication mechanism between plugins. It uses synchronous priority-ordered dispatch with `parking_lot::RwLock`.

### Event Types

| Event | Emitter | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `file.discovered` | Discovery | New file found during scan |
| `file.introspected` | CLI (introspect helper) | File metadata extracted via ffprobe |
| `file.introspection_failed` | CLI (introspect helper) | File introspection failed |
| `introspect.session.completed` | CLI (`process` command) | End of a standalone re-introspection batch (one per run); session-level, not per-file — for per-file see `file.introspected` |
| `scan.complete` | CLI (`scan` command) | End of a discovery + introspection scan; carries both totals |
| `metadata.enriched` | WASM plugins | External metadata added |
| `plan.created` | CLI (process command) | Execution plan dispatched for executor claiming |
| `plan.executing` | CLI (process command) | Plan execution about to start (triggers backup) |
| `plan.completed` | CLI (process command) | Plan execution succeeded |
| `plan.failed` | CLI (process command) | Plan execution failed or no executor claimed |
| `job.started` | Job Manager | Background job started |
| `job.progress` | Job Manager | Job progress update |
| `job.completed` | Job Manager | Job finished |
| `tool.detected` | Tool Detector | External tool found |

### Dispatch Model

Events are published to all subscribed plugins, ordered by priority (lower = runs first). Each subscriber can optionally return an `EventResult` that may influence downstream processing.

### Retention invariants

`event_log` records every event dispatched on the bus, including
`job.started` and `job.completed`. `jobs` records one row per work item the
worker pool processed.

For a single `voom process` run, the event_log gains roughly **seven rows
per job row**: file.discovered, file.introspected, three plan.* rows for
files that were transformed, plus job.started/completed. Default retention
must therefore keep `event_log` at *least* `7×` longer than `jobs`, on
both axes (`keep_last` and `keep_for_days`), or the event log will be
pruned while jobs survive — producing the misleading appearance that jobs
completed without announcing themselves on the bus.

The shipped defaults satisfy this: `jobs.keep_last = 50_000` and
`event_log.keep_last = 500_000`; `jobs.keep_for_days = 7` and
`event_log.keep_for_days = 60`. Operators who tighten `event_log` in
`config.toml` should keep the multiplier in mind — `voom health check`
warns when the oldest event is newer than the oldest job (issue #194).

## CLI Dual-Dispatch Pattern

CLI commands (`scan`, `process`) use a **hybrid approach**: direct plugin calls for CLI control flow, with event publishing for plugin coordination. This is an intentional architectural decision, not interim scaffolding.

### How it works

1. **Direct calls** drive the CLI workflow — discovery scanning, introspection, policy evaluation, and phase orchestration are called directly so the CLI controls progress reporting, error handling, and concurrency.
2. **Event publishing** notifies downstream plugins — after each direct call completes, the CLI dispatches the corresponding event (`FileIntrospected`, `PlanCreated`, `PlanExecuting`, etc.) through the kernel's event bus.
3. **Passive subscribers** (sqlite-store, backup-manager, web-server SSE, WASM metadata plugins) react to these events without the CLI needing to call them directly.

### Why not fully event-driven

Three CLI requirements cannot be satisfied by the current event bus:

- **Progress reporting** — Progress bars are driven by direct return values and worker pool callbacks (`on_job_start`, `on_job_complete`). The event bus is fire-and-forget with no feedback channel to the caller.
- **Error strategies** — `ErrorStrategy::Fail` cancels a `CancellationToken` to stop all workers immediately; `Skip`/`Continue` let the batch proceed. The event bus has no batch-level error strategy — a failed handler produces a `PluginError` event but cannot halt or skip processing.
- **Concurrency control** — The worker pool uses `tokio::Semaphore` to limit concurrent file processing. The event bus dispatches synchronously in priority order with no parallelism.

### Side-effect safety

There is no duplication of side effects. CLI commands never call storage methods (`upsert_file`, `save_plan`, `update_plan_status`) directly. All persistence flows exclusively through event dispatch to sqlite-store's `on_event` handler, ensuring a single write path.

### Per-command details

| Command | Direct calls | Events dispatched |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `scan` | `discovery.scan()`, `introspect_file()` | `FileDiscovered`, `FileIntrospected`, `FileIntrospectionFailed` |
| `process` | `discovery.scan()`, `introspect_file()`, `evaluate()`, `orchestrate()` | `FileDiscovered`, `FileIntrospected`, `PlanExecuting`, `PlanCreated`, `PlanCompleted`/`PlanFailed` |

Both commands dispatch `FileDiscovered` events so sqlite-store records files in the
`discovered_files` staging table. Introspection is driven directly by the CLI for deterministic
progress reporting and worker-pool concurrency.

## Domain Model

### Core Types

- **`MediaFile`** — Represents a media file with path, size, content hash, container format, duration, tracks, tags, and plugin metadata.
- **`Track`** — Individual stream within a media file (video, audio, subtitle, attachment) with codec, language, channel info, resolution, HDR/VFR flags.
- **`TrackType`** — Classified track type: `Video`, `AudioMain`, `AudioAlternate`, `AudioCommentary`, `SubtitleMain`, `SubtitleForced`, etc.
- **`Plan`** — Serializable execution plan linking a file + policy + phase to a list of `PlannedAction`s.
- **`PlannedAction`** — Single operation (e.g., `SetDefault`, `RemoveTrack`, `TranscodeVideo`) with parameters.
- **`BadFile`** — A file that failed introspection, with error details, attempt count, and timestamps.
- **`Event`** — Tagged union of all event types for inter-plugin communication.
- **`Capability`** — What a plugin can do, used for routing.

### Storage

SQLite database in WAL mode with r2d2 connection pool. Tables: `files`, `tracks`, `jobs`, `plans`, `processing_stats`, `plugin_data`, `bad_files`, `discovered_files`. All domain types are serde-serializable (JSON + MessagePack). The `bad_files` table tracks files that failed introspection, with upsert semantics that increment `attempt_count` on repeated failures. The `discovered_files` table is a staging table that tracks files from discovery through introspection (statuses: `pending` → `introspecting` → `completed` | `failed`).

## DSL Pipeline

Policy files use `.voom` extension and a custom curly-brace block syntax:

```
Source (.voom) → pest parser → CST → AST builder → PolicyAst
    → Validator (semantic checks) → Compiler → CompiledPolicy
```

The validator catches: unknown codecs (with did-you-mean suggestions), circular phase dependencies, unreachable phases, conflicting actions, and invalid language codes.

See [DSL Language Reference](dsl-reference.md) for the complete language specification.

## Web UI

The web server plugin provides:
- **REST API** at `/api/*` — JSON endpoints for files, jobs, plugins, stats, policy validation/formatting
- **Web pages** — Dashboard, library browser, file detail, policy editor, job monitor, plugin manager, settings
- **SSE** at `/events` — Server-Sent Events for live updates (scan progress, job status)
- **Security** — CSP headers, optional token-based auth, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options

Built with axum 0.7, Tera templates, htmx for server-driven updates, and Alpine.js for client-side state. Dark-themed UI with no build step required.
